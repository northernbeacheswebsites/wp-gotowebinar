WP GoToWebinar displays a listing or calendar of upcoming webinars using a shortcode or widget which can link to a registration form on your website.


== Description ==

WP GoToWebinar is a totally free plugin used to display a listing of upcoming GoToWebinars from your GoToWebinar account. The listing can be displayed on any post or page using the simple shortcode: [gotowebinar] or you can add the GoToWebinar widget to your sidebar. You can even display your webinars using a calendar view using the shortcode: [gotowebinar-calendar]. There's also a range of filters that can be used including:

1. Show webinars from a particular timezone
2. If the title contains particular text
3. If the title doesn't contain particular text
4. Show webinars within the next X days

You can also hide a word or phrase in the title from showing using the hide shortcode parameter. The shortcode listing displays:

1. The title of the webinar
2. A description of the webinar which is shown when clicking on the info icon
3. The date (and applicable timezone) of the webinar
4. The start time of the webinar
5. The duration of the webinar
6. A registration link of the webinar

As well as displaying webinars, users can also register for webinars from your website! You can also show a registration form for a specific webinar using the [gotowebinar-reg key="YOUR WEBINAR KEY"] shortcode or you can show a registration form for you next upcoming webinar with this shortcode: [gotowebinar-reg key="upcoming"]. 

In the plugin settings you can choose the date format, disable tool tips as well as change the colors of links, tooltips and buttons. You can also allow users to convert the times and dates into their local timezone. You can even override the registration form fields with your custom text making it translatable as well.

WP GoToWebinar is mobile friendly, secure with reCaptcha support, implements API request caching to make things super fast and it is also unobtrusive so it should adapt fairly well to your themes existing styles. It also includes Visual Composer elements so if you're using Visual Composer adding webinars or registration forms is really fast and easy.
